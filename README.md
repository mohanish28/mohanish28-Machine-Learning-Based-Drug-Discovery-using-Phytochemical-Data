# ðŸŒ¿ Machine Learning-Based Drug Discovery using Phytochemical Data

This project proposes a machine learning-based framework to identify potential drug candidates by analyzing phytochemical data derived from medicinal plants. The focus is on predicting drug efficacy (e.g., for Alzheimerâ€™s treatment) using models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
